In this code, I tried to implement OOP concepts that we worked on in class.
I mainly used the TicTacToe Last Phase as my template for the project and 
enhanced it to work for a UltimateTicTacToe board. I was able to implement 
this by using the otherBoard and otherBoardWrappers classes to make the 
bigger board while the board class and box class helped make the smaller board.
I would try to do this project in a simpler manner the next time around, mostly
because during the completion of the project, many errors occurred due to 
problems with transferring methods throughout the classes. My code provides
a list of possible legal moves to each player along with only taking valid user inputs 
for the player vs ai and player vs player modes of gameplay. The ai vs ai 
mode uses random numbers for its inputs.
